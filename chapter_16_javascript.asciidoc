.ðŸš§ Warning, Chapter update in progress
*******************************************************************************
This chapter is currently in the process of being rewritten for the 3e.

It's very rough at the moment!

*******************************************************************************

Our new validation logic is good,
but wouldn't it be nice if the duplicate item error messages disappeared
once the user started fixing the problem?
Just like our nice HTML5 validation errors do?
For that we'd need a teeny-tiny bit of JavaScript.

Python is a delightful language to program in.
JavaScript wasn't always that.
But many of the rough edges have been smoothed off,
and I think it's fair to say that it's actually quite nice now.
And in the world of web development, it's unavoidable.
So let's dip our toes in, and see if we can't have fun.

NOTE: ((("JavaScript testing", "additional resources")))I'm
  going to assume you know the basics of JavaScript syntax.
  https://amzn.to/3UXVUKd[JavaScript: The Good Parts] was the best guide,
  once upon a time.  Nowadays many of the "bad parts" it warns again
  have actually been fixed, so it's a little out of date.
  Try it, but if you find it anachronistic, I've heard good things about
  https://eloquentjavascript.net[Eloquent JavaScript].



=== Starting with an FT

((("JavaScript testing", "functional test")))
((("functional tests (FTs)", "JavaScript", id="FTjava16")))
Let's add a new functional test to the `ItemValidationTest` class:

[role="sourcecode"]
.src/functional_tests/test_list_item_validation.py (ch16l001)
====
[source,python]
----
def test_error_messages_are_cleared_on_input(self):
    # Edith starts a list and causes a validation error:
    self.browser.get(self.live_server_url)
    self.get_item_input_box().send_keys("Banter too thick")
    self.get_item_input_box().send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
    self.wait_for_row_in_list_table("1: Banter too thick")
    self.get_item_input_box().send_keys("Banter too thick")
    self.get_item_input_box().send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
    self.wait_for(  # <1>
        lambda: self.assertTrue(  # <1>
            self.browser.find_element(
                By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".invalid-feedback"
            ).is_displayed()  # <2>
        )
    )

    # She starts typing in the input box to clear the error
    self.get_item_input_box().send_keys("a")

    # She is pleased to see that the error message disappears
    self.wait_for(
        lambda: self.assertFalse(
            self.browser.find_element(
                By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".invalid-feedback"
            ).is_displayed()  # <2>
        )
    )
----
====

<1> We use another of our `wait_for` invocations, this time with `assertTrue`.

<2> `is_displayed()` tells you whether an element is visible or not.
    We can't just rely on checking whether the element is _present_ in the DOM,
    because we're now going to mark elements as hidden,
    rather than removing them from the DOM altogether.


That fails appropriately:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
FAIL: test_error_messages_are_cleared_on_input
(functional_tests.test_list_item_validation.ItemValidationTest.test_error_messages_are_cleared_on_input)
  File ".../src/functional_tests/test_list_item_validation.py", line 89, in
  <lambda>
    lambda: self.assertFalse(
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError: True is not false
----

But, before we move on:  three strikes and refactor!
We've got several places where we find the error element using CSS. Let's
move it to a helper function:

[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/test_list_item_validation.py (ch16l002)
====
[source,python]
----
class ItemValidationTest(FunctionalTest):

    def get_error_element(self):
        return self.browser.find_element_by_css_selector('.has-error')

    [...]
----
====

TIP: I like to keep helper functions in the FT class that's using them, and
    only promote them to the base class when they're actually needed elsewhere.
    It stops the base class from getting too cluttered. YAGNI.

And we then make three replacements in 'test_list_item_validation', like this:

[role="sourcecode"]
.functional_tests/test_list_item_validation.py (ch16l003)
====
[source,python]
----
    self.wait_for(
        lambda: self.assertEqual(
            self.get_error_element().text,
            "You've already got this in your list",
        )
    )
[...]
    self.wait_for(
        lambda: self.assertTrue(self.get_error_element().is_displayed()),
    )
[...]
    self.wait_for(
        lambda: self.assertFalse(self.get_error_element().is_displayed()),
    )
----
====

We still have our expected failure:

[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test functional_tests.test_list_item_validation*]
[...]
    self.get_error_element().is_displayed()
AssertionError: True is not false
----

And we can commit this as the first cut of our FT.


Setting Up a Basic JavaScript Test Runner


((("test running libraries")))
((("JavaScript testing", "test running libraries", id="JStestrunner16")))
((("pytest")))
Choosing your testing tools in the Python is fairly straightforward.
The standard library `unittest` package is perfectly adequate,
and the Django test runner also makes a good default choice.
More and more though, people will choose http://pytest.org/[pytest]
for its `assert` based assertions, and its fixture management.
We don't need to get into the pros and cons now!
The point is that there's a "good enough" default,
and there's one main popular alternative.footnote:[
Admittedly once you start looking for Python BDD tools,
things are a little more confusing.]

The JavaScript world has more of a proliferation!
Mocha, Karma, Jester, Chai, Ava, and Tape are just a few of the options
I came across when researching the Third Edition.

I chose Jasmine, because it's still popular despite being around for nearly a decade,
and because it offers a "standalone" test runner that you can use
without needing to dive into the whole Node/NPM ecosystem.
((("Jasmine")))


Let's download the so-called "standalone" version of Jasmine,
which will let us run tests in a normal browser:

[role="small-code"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *wget -O jasmine.zip \
  https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases/download/v4.6.1/jasmine-standalone-4.6.1.zip*
$ *unzip jasmine.zip -d src/lists/static/tests*
$ *rm jasmine.zip*
# if you're on windows you may not have wget or unzip,
# but i'm sure you can manage to manually download and unzip the jasmine release

# delete some of the example files we don't need
$ *rm -r src/lists/static/tests/src*
$ *rm src/lists/static/tests/spec/SpecHelper.js*

# move the example tests "Spec" file to a more central location
$ *mv src/lists/static/tests/spec/PlayerSpec.js src/lists/static/tests/Spec.js*
$ *rmdir src/lists/static/tests/spec/"
----
//004, 005

That leaves us with a directory structure like this:

[role="dofirst-ch14l004"]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *tree src/lists/static/tests/*
src/lists/static/tests

        â”œâ”€â”€ jasmine.js
        â””â”€â”€ jasmine_favicon.png
----

We need to go edit the _SpecRunner.html_ file to take into account the things we've moved around:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/tests.html (ch16l006)
[source,diff]
----

----

We change the "source files" to point at a (for-now imaginary) _superlists.js_ file
that we'll put into the _static_ folder,
and we change the "spec files" to point at a single _Spec.js_ file,
in the _static/tests_ folder.

Now let's open up the _Spec.js_ file,
and strip it down to a single minimal smoke test:




[role="sourcecode"]
.src/lists/static/tests/Spec.js (ch16l007)
====
[source,python]
----
describe("Superlists tests", () => {  //<1><2>

  it("smoke test", () => {  //<3>
    expect(1 + 1).toEqual(2);  //<4>
  });

});
----
====


<1> The `describe` block is a way of grouping tests together,
    a bit like we use classes in our Python tests.

<2> If your javascript is a little rusty,
    you may not have seen this "arrow function" syntax, `() => {...}`.
    It's basically the new way of writing anonymous functions.
    I think they're cute!

<3> The `it` block is a single test, a bit like a method in a Python test class.
    Similarly to the `describe` block, we have a name, and then an arrow function
    to capture the body of the test

<4> Now we have our assertion.  This is a little different from assertions
    in unittest, it's using what's sometimes called "expect" syntax,
    often also seen in the Ruby world.
    We wrap our "actual" value in the `expect()` function,
    and then our assertions are methods on the expect object,
    where `.toEqual` is the equivalent of `assertEqual` in Python.


Let's see how that looks in our browser (<<jasmine-specrunner-green>>):

[[jasmine-specrunner-green]]
.The Jasmine Spec runner in action

Let's try adding a deliberate failure to see what that looks like:

====
[source,python]
----
  it("smoke test", () => {
    expect(1 + 1).toEqual(3);
  });

Now if we refresh our browser, we'll see red (<<jasmine-specrunner-red>>):

=== Testing with some DOM content

// dofirst ch16l009

// TODO, resume here


((("JavaScript testing", "jQuery and fixtures div", id="JSjquery16")))((("jQuery", id="jquery16")))((("fixtures div", id="fixtures16")))Let's
get a bit more comfortable with what our testing framework can do,
and start using a bit of jQuery--an almost indispensable library that
gives you a cross-browser-compatible API for manipulating the DOM.

NOTE: If you've never seen jQuery before, I'm going to try to explain it as we
    go, just enough so that you won't be totally lost; but this isn't a jQuery
    tutorial.  You may find it helpful to spend an hour or two investigating
    jQuery at some point during this chapter.

Download the latest jQuery from https://jquery.com/download/[jquery.com] and
save it into the _lists/static_ folder.

Then let's start using it in our tests file, along with adding a couple of
HTML elements. We'll start by seeing if we can show and hide an element,
and write some assertions about its visibility:

[role="sourcecode dofirstch14l005"]
.lists/static/tests/tests.html
====
[source,html]
----
  <div id="qunit-fixture"></div>

  <form>  <1>
    <input name="text" />
    <div class="has-error">Error text</div>
  </form>

  <script src="../jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script> <2>
  <script src="qunit-2.6.0.js"></script>

  <script>

QUnit.test("smoke test", function (assert) {
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), true);  //<3><4>
  $('.has-error').hide();  //<5>
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), false);  //<6>
});

  </script>
----
====
//ch14l006

// TODO: is:visible  can be replace by checkVisibility: https://stackoverflow.com/a/72717388/366221

<1> The `<form>` and its contents are there to represent what will be
    on the real list page.

<2> Here's where we load jQuery.

<3> jQuery magic starts here!  `$` is the jQuery Swiss Army knife. It's
    used to find bits of the DOM.  Its first argument is a CSS selector; here,
    we're telling it to find all elements that have the class "has-error".  It
    returns an object that represents one or more DOM elements. That, in turn,
    has various useful methods that allow us to manipulate or find out about
    those elements.

<4> One of which is `.is`, which can tell us whether an element matches a
    particular CSS property. Here we use `:visible` to check whether the
    element is displayed or hidden.

<5> We then use jQuery's `.hide()` method to hide the div.  Behind the
    scenes, it dynamically sets a `style="display: none"` on the element.

<6> And finally we check that it's worked, with a second `assert.equal`.


If you refresh the browser, you should see that all passes:

.Expected results from QUnit in the browser
====
[role="qunit-output"]
----
2 assertions of 2 passed, 0 failed.
1. smoke test (2)
----
====

Time to see how fixtures work. Let's just dupe up this test:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/tests.html
====
[source,html]
----
  <script>

QUnit.test("smoke test", function (assert) {
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), true);
  $('.has-error').hide();
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), false);
});
QUnit.test("smoke test 2", function (assert) {
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), true);
  $('.has-error').hide();
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), false);
});

  </script>
----
====

Slightly unexpectedly, we find one of them fails--see <<one-test-is-failing>>.

[[one-test-is-failing]]
.One of the two tests is failing
image::images/twp2_1602.png["Qunit screen showing only 1 passing test"]

What's happening here is that the first test hides the error div, so when
the second test runs, it starts out invisible.

NOTE: QUnit tests do not run in a predictable order, so you can't rely on the
    first test running before the second one.  Try hitting refresh a few times,
    and you'll find that the test which fails changes...

We need some way of tidying up between tests, a bit like `setUp` and
`tearDown`, or like the Django test runner would reset the database between
each test.  The `qunit-fixture` div is what we're looking for.  Move the form
in there:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/tests.html
====
[source,html]
----
  <div id="qunit"></div>
  <div id="qunit-fixture">
      <form>
          <input name="text" />
          <div class="has-error">Error text</div>
      </form>
  </div>

  <script src="../jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
----
====
//008



((("", startref="JSjquery16")))((("", startref="jquery16")))((("", startref="fixtures16")))As
you've probably guessed, jQuery resets the content of the fixtures div
before each test, so that gets us back to two neatly passing tests:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
4 assertions of 4 passed, 0 failed.
1. smoke test (2)
2. smoke test 2 (2)
----

Building a JavaScript Unit Test for Our Desired Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



((("JavaScript testing", "unit test")))((("unit tests", "JavaScript")))Now
that we're acquainted with our JavaScript testing tools, we can switch
back to just one test and start to write the real thing:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/tests.html
====
[source,html]
----
  <script>

QUnit.test("errors should be hidden on keypress", function (assert) {
  $('input[name="text"]').trigger('keypress'); // <1>
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), false);
});

  </script>
----
====

<1> The jQuery `.trigger` method is mainly used for testing.  It says "fire off
    a JavScript DOM event on the element(s)".  Here we use the 'keypress'
    event, which is fired off by the browser behind the scenes whenever a user
    types something into a particular input element.

NOTE: jQuery is hiding a lot of complexity behind the scenes here.  Check
    out http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/index.html[Quirksmode.org] for a
    view on the hideous nest of differences between the different browsers'
    interpretation of events.  The reason that jQuery is so popular is that it
    just makes all this stuff go away.

And that gives us:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
0 assertions of 1 passed, 1 failed.
1. errors should be hidden on keypress (1, 0, 1)
    1. failed
        Expected: false
        Result: true
----

Let's say we want to keep our code in a standalone JavaScript file called
'list.js'.


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/tests.html
====
[source,html]
----
  <script src="../jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
  <script src="../list.js"></script>
  <script src="qunit-2.6.0.js"></script>

  <script>
    [...]
----
====

Here's the minimal code to get that test to pass:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/list.js
====
[source,javascript]
----
$('.has-error').hide();
----
====

And it works...

[role="qunit-output"]
----
1 assertions of 1 passed, 0 failed.
1. errors should be hidden on keypress (1)
----

But it has an obvious problem. We'd better add another test:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/tests.html
====
[source,javascript]
----
QUnit.test("errors should be hidden on keypress", function (assert) {
  $('input[name="text"]').trigger('keypress');
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), false);
});

QUnit.test("errors aren't hidden if there is no keypress", function (assert) {
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), true);
});
----
====

Now we get an expected failure:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
1 assertions of 2 passed, 1 failed.
1. errors should be hidden on keypress (1)
2. errors aren't hidden if there is no keypress (1, 0, 1)
    1. failed
        Expected: true
        Result: false
[...]
----

And we can make a more realistic implementation:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/list.js
====
[source,javascript]
----
$('input[name="text"]').on('keypress', function () { //<1>
  $('.has-error').hide();
});
----
====

<1> This line says: find any input elements whose name attribute is "text", and
    add an event listener which reacts 'on' keypress events.  The event
    listener is the inline function, which hides all elements that have the
    class `.has-error`.


Does it work?  No.


[role="qunit-output"]
----
1 assertions of 2 passed, 1 failed.
1. errors should be hidden on keypress (1, 0, 1)
    1. failed
        Expected: false
        Result: true
[...]
2. errors aren't hidden if there is no keypress (1)
----

Curses!  Why is that?

Fixtures, Execution Order, and Global State: Key Challenges of JS Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("JavaScript testing", "managing global state")))((("global state")))((("JavaScript testing", "key challenges of", id="JSTkey16")))((("fixtures div")))One
of the difficulties with JavaScript in general, and testing in particular,
is in understanding the order of execution of our code (i.e., what happens when).
When does our code in 'list.js' run, and when does each of our tests run?  And
how does that interact with global state, that is, the DOM of our web page, and the
fixtures that we've already seen are supposed to be cleaned up after each test?


console.log for Debug Printing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

((("console.log")))Let's
add a couple of debug prints, or "console.logs":

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/tests.html
====
[source,html]
----
  <script>

console.log('qunit tests start');

QUnit.test("errors should be hidden on keypress", function (assert) {
  console.log('in test 1');
  $('input[name="text"]').trigger('keypress');
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), false);
});

QUnit.test("errors aren't hidden if there is no keypress", function (assert) {
  console.log('in test 2');
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), true);
});
  </script>
----
====

And the same in our actual JS code:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/list.js (ch14l015)
====
[source,javascript]
----
$('input[name="text"]').on('keypress', function () {
  console.log('in keypress handler');
  $('.has-error').hide();
});
console.log('list.js loaded');
----
====


Rerun the tests, opening up the browser debug console (Ctrl-Shift-I usually)
and you should see something like <<qunit-with-js-console>>.

[[qunit-with-js-console]]
.QUnit tests with console.log debug outputs
image::images/twp2_1603.png["QUnit tests with console.log debug outputs"]

What do we see?

* 'list.js' loads first.  So our event listener should be attached to the
  input element.
* Then our QUnit tests file loads.
* Then each test runs.

But, thinking it through, each test is going to "reset" the fixtures div, which
means destroying and re-creating the input element.  So the input element that
'list.js' sees and attaches the event listener to will be replaced with a new
one by the time each test runs.



Using an Initialize Function for More Control Over Execution Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We need more control over the order of execution of our JavaScript.  Rather
than just relying on the code in 'list.js' running whenever it is loaded by
a `<script>` tag, we can use a common pattern, which is to define an
"initialize" function, and call that when we want to in our tests (and
later in real life):


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/list.js
====
[source,javascript]
----
var initialize = function () {
  console.log('initialize called');
  $('input[name="text"]').on('keypress', function () {
    console.log('in keypress handler');
    $('.has-error').hide();
  });
};
console.log('list.js loaded');
----
====

And in our tests file, we call `initialize` with each test:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/tests.html (ch14l017)
====
[source,javascript]
----
QUnit.test("errors should be hidden on keypress", function (assert) {
  console.log('in test 1');
  initialize();
  $('input[name="text"]').trigger('keypress');
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), false);
});

QUnit.test("errors aren't hidden if there is no keypress", function (assert) {
  console.log('in test 2');
  initialize();
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), true);
});

----
====

Now we should see our tests pass, and our debug output should make
more sense:

[role="qunit-output"]
----
2 assertions of 2 passed, 0 failed.
1. errors should be hidden on keypress (1)
2. errors aren't hidden if there is no keypress (1)

list.js loaded
qunit tests start
in test 1
initialize called
in keypress handler
in test 2
initialize called
----

Hooray!  Let's strip out those console.logs:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/list.js
====
[source,javascript]
----
var initialize = function () {
  $('input[name="text"]').on('keypress', function () {
    $('.has-error').hide();
  });
};
----
====

And from the tests too...

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/tests.html
====
[source,javascript]
----
QUnit.test("errors should be hidden on keypress", function (assert) {
  initialize();
  $('input[name="text"]').trigger('keypress');
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), false);
});

QUnit.test("errors aren't hidden if there is no keypress", function (assert) {
  initialize();
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), true);
});
----
====


And for the moment of truth, we'll pull in jQuery, our script, and
invoke our initialize function on our real pages:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/base.html (ch14l020)
====
[source,html]
----
    </div>
    <script src="/static/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="/static/list.js"></script>

    <script>
      initialize();
    </script>

  </body>
</html>
----

NOTE: It's good practice to put your script loads at the end of your body HTML,
    as it means the user doesn't have to wait for all your JavaScript to load
    before they can see something on the page.  It also helps to make sure most
    of the DOM has loaded before any scripts run.

Aaaand we run our FT:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python manage.py test functional_tests.test_list_item_validation.\
ItemValidationTest.test_error_messages_are_cleared_on_input*
[...]

Ran 1 test in 3.023s

OK

((("", startref="JSTkey16")))Hooray!  That's a commit!

Columbo Says: Onload Boilerplate and Namespacing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


'Oh, and one more thing'.  ((("JavaScript testing", "boilerplate and namespacing")))Our
`initialize` function name is too generic--what
if we include some third-party JavaScript tool later that also defines a
function called `initialize`? Let's give ourselves a "namespace" that's
unlikely to be used by anyone else:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/list.js
====
[source,javascript]
----
window.Superlists = {}; //<1>
window.Superlists.initialize = function () { //<2>
  $('input[name="text"]').on('keypress', function () {
    $('.has-error').hide();
  });
};
----
====

<1> We explicitly declare an object as a property of the "window" global,
    giving it a name that we think no one else is likely to use.

<2> Then we make our `initialize` function an attribute of that namespace
    object.

TIP: There are lots of other, much cleverer ways of dealing with namespaces in
    JavaScript, but they are all more complicated, and I'm not enough of an
    expert to be able to steer you around them.  If you do want to learn
    more, search for 'require.js', which seemed to be the done thing, or at
    least it was in the last JavaScript femtosecond.


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/static/tests/tests.html
====
[source,html]
----
  <script>
QUnit.test("errors should be hidden on keypress", function (assert) {
  window.Superlists.initialize();
  $('input[name="text"]').trigger('keypress');
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), false);
});

QUnit.test("errors aren't hidden if there is no keypress", function (assert) {
  window.Superlists.initialize();
  assert.equal($('.has-error').is(':visible'), true);
});
  </script>
----

Finally, whenever you have some JavaScript that interacts with the DOM, it's
always good to wrap it in some "onload" boilerplate code to make sure that the
page has fully loaded before it tries to do anything. Currently it works
anyway, because we've placed the `<script>` tag right at the bottom of the
page, but we shouldn't rely on that.


The jQuery `onload` boilerplate is quite minimal:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/templates/base.html
====
[source,javascript]
----
    <script>

$(document).ready(function () {
  window.Superlists.initialize();
});

    </script>

JavaScript Testing in the TDD Cycle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



((("JavaScript testing", "in the TDD cycle", secondary-sortas="TDD cycle")))((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "JavaScipt testing in")))You
may be wondering how these JavaScript tests fit in with our "double loop"
TDD cycle.  The answer is that they play exactly the same role as our
Python unit tests.

1. Write an FT and see it fail.
2. Figure out what kind of code you need next: Python or JavaScript?
3. Write a unit test in either language, and see it fail.
4. Write some code in either language, and make the test pass.
5. Rinse and repeat.



NOTE: Want a little more practice with JavaScript?  See if you can get our
    error messages to be hidden when the user clicks inside the input element,
    as well as just when they type in it.  You should be able to FT it too.


We're almost ready to move on to <<part3>>.  The last step is to deploy our
new code to our servers. Don't forget to do a final commit including
'base.html' first!


A Few Things That Didn't Make It
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("JavaScript testing", "additional considerations for")))In
this chapter I wanted to cover the very basics of JavaScript testing and how
it fits into our TDD workflow in this chapter.  Here are a few pointers for
further research:

* At the moment, our test only checks that the JavaScript works on one page.
  It works because we're including it in 'base.html', but if we'd only
  added it to 'home.html' the tests would still pass.  It's a judgement
  call, but you could choose to write an extra test here.

* ((("JavaScript testing", "syntax errors")))When
writing JavaScript, get as much help from your editor as you can to
  avoid common "gotchas".  Check out syntax/error-checking tools like
  "jslint" and "jshint", also known as "linters".


* ((("QUnit")))QUnit
mainly expects you to "run" your tests using an actual web browser.
  This has the advantage that it's easy to create some HTML fixtures that
  match the kind of HTML your site actually contains, for tests to run against.
  But it's also possible to run JS tests from the command line.  We'll see
  an example in <<chapter_CI>>.

* ((("MVC frameworks")))((("angular.js")))((("React")))The
new shiny thing in the world of frontend development are MVC frameworks
  like 'angular.js' and React.  ((("Jasmine")))Most
tutorials for these use an RSpec-like
  assertion library called https://jasmine.github.io/[Jasmine].  If you're
  going to use one of them, you'll probably find life easier if you use Jasmine
  rather than QUnit.






There is more JavaScript fun in this book too!  Have a look at the
<<appendix_rest_api,Rest API appendix>> when you're ready for it.((("", startref="FTjava16")))

.JavaScript Testing Notes
*******************************************************************************

* ((("Selenium", "and JavaScript", secondary-sortas="JavaScript")))One
of the great advantages of Selenium is that it allows you to test that
  your JavaScript really works, just as it tests your Python code.

* ((("JavaScript testing", "test running libraries")))There
are many JavaScript test running libraries out there.  QUnit is closely
  tied to jQuery, which is the main reason I chose it.

* ((("JavaScript testing", "managing global state")))((("global state")))No
matter which testing library you use, you'll always need to find solutions
  to the main challenge of JavaScript testing, which is about 'managing global
  state'.  That includes:
    - the DOM / HTML fixtures
    - namespacing
    - understanding and controlling execution order.

* I don't really mean it when I say that JavaScript is awful. It can actually
  be quite fun.  But I'll say it again: make sure you've read
  <<jsgoodparts,'JavaScript: The Good Parts'>>.
